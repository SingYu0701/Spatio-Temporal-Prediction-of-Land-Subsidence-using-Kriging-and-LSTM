# Spatio-Temporal-Prediction-of-Land-Subsidence-using-Kriging-and-LSTM
This project develops a spatio-temporal prediction framework for land subsidence by integrating **geostatistical interpolation** and **deep learning**. The study focuses on the Yunlin region in Taiwan, where groundwater over-extraction has caused severe subsidence.
